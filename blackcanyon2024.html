<h1><u>How I trained for the 2024 Black Canyon 100k</u></h1>
<h3>Background </h3>
<body>
  After a lackluster end of 2023 where I DNFed Javelina Jundred at mile 60, I was looking for a redemption race, as well as a motivating factor to train through the North Dakota winter and put together a 12-15 week training cycle -- something I hadn't done in a while. After Javelina Jundred, I took about a week off completely from running before getting some runs back into my schedule.
</body>
<h3>Totals</h3>
In total, I ran 489 miles in 82 hours over the course of the 13 week training block from November 7th, 2023 to February 4th, 2024.


<h2><u>Training</u></h2>


<h3>Nov 6 - 12 2023</h3>
<b>17.2 miles - 3h 25m</b><br>
<body>This week was my first week back from Javelina Jundred. It was all easy mileage.</body>

<h3>Nov 13 - 19 2023</h3>
<b>30.92 miles - 6h 28m</b><br>
<body>I started to get my mileage build going, and did a light threshold workout on Wednesday. The annual Thanksgiving Turkey Trot would be next week.</body>

<h3>Nov 20 - 26 2023</h3>
<b>30.92 miles (again) - 4h 38m</b><br>
<body>This week consisted of more easy runs. On Thursday (Thanksgiving), I ran the 2023 Turkey Trot in 19:59, succesfully continuing my yearly sub-20 minute streak. I finished with my first "longer" run on Sunday with 75 minutes on the work treadmill.</body>

<h3>Nov 27 - Dec 3 2023</h3>
<b>35.3 miles - 5h 43m</b><br>
<body>I increased my weekly mileage by 5 miles this week. I did mainly easy runs and on Saturday ran 11 miles at 7:57 pace with Andy Nielsen and Kobe Berger. This was a higher effort run for me given my current fitness and stage in the training block. It was a nice confidence booster, though.</body>

<h3>Dec 4 - 10 2023</h3>
<b>40.2 miles - 6h 34m</b><br>
<body>I increased my weekly mileage by 5 miles this week. I started introducing a weekly long run as well as a workout. This would remain the pattern for the rest of the block.</body><br>
<b>Workout:</b><br>
10 miles - 7:54 / mile <br>
2x25 minutes SteadyState with 4 min recovery. First rep was 7:25 / mile, second rep was 7:24 / mile.
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
12 miles in 1h 57m with Pat and Jes.<br>We had just recently gotten a lot of snow and ice and so it was slow going in trail shoes. Also very cold that day.

<h3>Dec 11 - 17 2023</h3>
<b>45.6 miles - 9h 11m</b><br>
<body>This was a big week for me. It was a high amount of volume and I was also able to travel to Arizona and do one of the Black Canyon Training runs that weekend.</body><br>
<b>Workout:</b><br>
6.5 miles - 7:44 / mile <br>
40 minutes SteadyState. 7:25 / mile average.
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
18 miles in 3h 48m with 2,080 ft climb on the Black Canyon Trail.<br>
This was a pretty challenging run due to my current fitness level as well as my environmental tempurature acclimation at the time. It was still 75-80 degrees in Phoenix and I was used to 30 degrees in Bismarck. I had a run-in with a cactus on this training run which was an added humorous bonus.

<h3>Dec 18 - 24 2023</h3>
<b>32.9 miles - 5h 38m</b><br>
<body>This was a down week for me. Recovering from the big weekend before and also enjoying the holidays a little bit.</body>
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
12 miles in 2h 3m with Dustin.<br>
This Christmas Eve run was pretty humourously brutal with high wind gusts and sheer ice on the ground. We both took a few spills but managed to get it done.

<h3>Dec 25 - 31 2023</h3>
<b>44.9 miles - 6h 37m</b><br>
<body>Back to regular mileage.</body>
<br><b>Workout:</b><br>
11.4 miles - 8:12 / mile with Kobe <br>
"Michigan":<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    1 mile at 10k pace (6:39)  - 2:30 jog rest
  </li>
  <li>
    1 mile at HM pace (7:15) - 2:00 jog rest
  </li>
    <li>
    1200m at 10k pace (5:04) - 2:00 jog  rest
  </li>
    <li>
    1 mile at HM pace (7:08) - 2:00 jog rest
  </li>
      <li>
    800m at 5k pace (3:09) - 3:00 jog rest
  </li>
      <li>
    1 mile at HM pace (7:06) - 2:00 jog rest
  </li>
        <li>
    400m at 5k pace (1:37) - 3:00 jog rest
  </li>
</ul>
This was a good one, nice variation of paces and was starting to feel strong at HM/M pace. It was very icy and Kobe and I had to dodge a lot of cars as the bike paths were not clear and so we had to run on the road.
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
14 miles @ 8:27 / mile in 1h 58m with Kobe.<br>
We ran from my house to McDowell Dam and back. It was really cold and windy, quite a bit of suffering on this one.

<h3>Jan 1 - 7 2024</h3>
<b>45.3 miles - 8h 9m</b><br>
<b>Workout:</b><br>
11 miles - 7:55 / mile with Kobe.<br>
"1+2 Mile Compound":<br>
2 x 1 mile (10k pace) straight into 2 miles (Marathon Pace). 5 minute jog in between.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Rep 1: 1 Mile - 6:44
  </li>
  <li>
    Rep 1: 2 Mile - 14:39 (7:19 / mile)
  </li>
  <li>
    Rep 2: 1 Mile - 6:46
  </li>
  <li>
    Rep 2: 2 Mile - 14:39 (7:19 / mile)
  </li>
</ul>
This was a tough one, but a good one. Starting to feel very strong at M pace.
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
14 miles in 2h 10m with Pat, Jes, and Allison on the Old Red Trail bike path.<br>

<h3>Jan 8 - 14 2024</h3>
<b>45.1 miles - 7h 22m</b><br>
<body>This was a tough week for me. Temps dropped to sub zero with negative -40 wind chills starting Thursday, which meant a lot of treadmill running the back half of the week into the next week. I also got sick on Saturday.</body>
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
20 miles in 3h 5m.<br>
With the sub zero temps impending, I took off from work early on Tuesday and got out for my long run. 

<h3>Jan 15 - 21 2024</h3>
<b>45.6 miles - 7h 11m</b><br>
<body>Sub zero tempatures again for most of this week, confining me indoors on the treadmill for most of it.</body>
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
15.5 miles in 2h 30m.<br>
Did this on Wednesday on the work treadmill. Kobe did a threshold workout and we watched some random NCAA hockey on the TV.

<h3>Jan 22 - 28 2024</h3>
<b>35.3 miles - 5h 4m</b><br>
<body>Starting to reduce mileage to get ready for the race.</body>

40 mins steady state (7:18 / mile) with Kobe.
<br><b>Long Run:</b><br>
10.18 miles in 1h 24m with Kobe around town.

<h3>Jan 29 - Feb 4 2024</h3>
